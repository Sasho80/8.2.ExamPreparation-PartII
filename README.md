01.Problem: Distance
Write a program that calculates what is the distance passed by a car (in kilometers), if we know the 
initial speed (km/h), the initial time frame in minutes, then the speed is increased by 10%, the second 
time frame, then the speed is decreased by 5%, and the time until the end of the trip. In order to 
calculate the distance, you need to convert the minutes into hours (e.g. 70 minutes = 1.1666 hours).
Input Data
The input comes from the console and consists of 4 lines:
• The initial speed in km/h – an integer within the range [1 … 300].
• The first time frame in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].
• The second time frame in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].
• The third time frame in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].
Output Data
Print a number on the console: the kilometers passed, formatted up to the second digit after the 
decimal point.
